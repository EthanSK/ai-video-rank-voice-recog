# Voice Recognition System Improvements

## Fixed Issues

The voice recognition system has been completely rearchitected to solve the real-time speech logging problems.

### Root Cause Analysis

The original system had several fundamental issues:

1. **Too-short audio chunks**: 1.5-second chunks were insufficient for meaningful speech recognition
2. **Processing gaps**: Whisper processing time exceeded chunk duration, creating gaps in recognition
3. **Poor error handling**: System would fail completely on missing dependencies
4. **Limited debugging**: Insufficient logging made troubleshooting difficult

### Improvements Made

#### 1. Better Audio Processing
- **Increased chunk size**: Now uses 3-second chunks for better speech context
- **Processing locks**: Prevents overlapping Whisper calls that caused conflicts
- **Improved timing**: Better coordination between recording and processing cycles

#### 2. Enhanced Real-time Logging
- **Comprehensive SoX logging**: Shows audio input status and capture details
- **Detailed Whisper output**: Logs transcription process step-by-step  
- **Command detection logging**: Shows exactly when and how commands are detected
- **Processing status**: Clear indication of when audio is being processed

#### 3. System Resilience
- **Graceful dependency handling**: System continues even with missing components
- **Optional display manager**: Voice recognition works independently of Puppeteer
- **Better error messages**: Clear instructions for fixing dependency issues

#### 4. Testing and Debugging
- **Isolated test script**: `npm run test-voice` tests voice recognition only
- **Detailed status output**: Every step of the process is logged
- **Command callback system**: Both registered handlers and callbacks are triggered

## Usage

### Full System
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Voice Recognition Only
```bash
npm run test-voice
```

### Expected Output

When working correctly, you should see:
1. SoX audio capture status
2. Real-time transcription from Whisper
3. Command detection and execution
4. Clear error messages if dependencies are missing

### Dependencies

Required for voice recognition:
- **SoX**: Audio recording (`brew install sox` on macOS)
- **Whisper**: Speech recognition (`pip install openai-whisper`)
- **Microphone access**: System must be able to access default microphone

## Debugging

The improved system provides extensive logging:

- `üé§ SoX status`: Shows audio input capture
- `ü§ñ Whisper stdout/stderr`: Shows transcription process
- `üó£Ô∏è SPEECH DETECTED`: Shows recognized speech
- `üéØ Processing command`: Shows command parsing
- `‚ú® COMMAND KEYWORD FOUND`: Shows successful command detection

This makes it easy to identify exactly where any issues occur in the pipeline.
